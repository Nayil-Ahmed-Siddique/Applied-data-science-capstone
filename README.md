# Home Loan Prediction <br>

This is a project done by me(Nayil) while being an Intern at Inventeron Technologies. <br>

1. Completed an on-site internship, gaining hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models, as well as conducting data analytics using Python. <br>
2. Developed a home loan data analysis model leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, which improved the overall prediction accuracy and provided actionable insights for decision-making.  <br>
3. Collaborated with a team of data scientists to analyze large and complex datasets, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to extract meaningful insights. <br>
4. Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, and employed frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to implement predictive models. <br>
5. Delivered findings and insights to stakeholders through clear and concise visualizations, supporting data-driven decision-making and strategy planning. <br>
